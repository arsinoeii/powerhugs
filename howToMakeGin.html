                  A great gin starts with a great mash. Fortunately, gin’s base
                  spirit can be made by fermenting and distilling almost any
                  agricultural product. As a result, there are a ton of
                  different variations of mash types to choose from when making
                  gin. Most gins are made using a variety of grain such as corn,
                  barley or wheat. Although, there are many exceptions to this
                  as well. Distilleries have been known to use honey, molasses,
                  apples, potatoes, grapes, carrots and many other ingredients
                  in their gin mash bills. For this walkthrough guide, we’ll be
                  using wheat, rye, and malted barley for our gin mash
                  ingredients. But feel free to use whatever ingredients you
                  would like to for the first phase of distillation.

                  Also known as Sour Mash, this is the key first ingredient in
                  making Gin. Get a mixture of grain, malt and water – and
                  condition with some amount of spent mash (previously fermented
                  and distilled mash that still contains dead yeast, a good food
                  source for live yeast).

                  Store your gin mash and let ferment for 1 to 2 weeks. Use the
                  method below to ensure a successful fermentation phase Check
                  Fermentation: After 1 week of fermentation, take a bit of
                  liquid (no solids) from the top of your gin mash. Put the
                  liquid on a white plate or lid. Drip several drops of iodine
                  into the liquid. If the liquid turns blue, this is because the
                  iodine has reacted with starches still in your gin mash. This
                  indicates that the mash still requires further fermentation.
                  Repeat this process every few days until the fermentation
                  stage is complete (no blue liquid)

                  Siphon some mash water out of your mixture, leaving behind ALL
                  solid material and sediments, and into a container to adjust
                  pH. At this step, you should use a cheesecloth to strain your
                  gin mash water. Leaving solid materials or sediment in your
                  gin mash water will cause problems with the distillation
                  phase. (Advanced Tip!) Some distillers will add 2tsp of gypsum
                  to their gin mash water at this point. They then test the pH
                  of their mash water. The ideal pH is 5.8 to 6.0. Use citric
                  acid to adjust the pH down and calcium carbonate to bring it
                  up.

                  This is where things get very exciting and experimental!
                  Botanicals are the ingredients that set gin apart from other
                  spirits like moonshine and vodka. The distilled spirit absorbs
                  these gin botanicals while passing through the still’s column.
                  Every gin has a different blend of botanical ingredients. Some
                  of the most popular gin botanicals that distillers prefer to
                  use in their spirits include:

                  So far so good! You’ve done all of the work necessary to
                  actually produce your own fermented gin mash water. Next,
                  you’ll make your gin mash water a purer and concentrated
                  spirit by distilling it. The distillation process removes
                  undesirable contents from the gin mash water that you’ll need
                  to separate out and dispose of. These include types alcohols
                  such as acetaldehyde, acetone, and methanol. These undesirable
                  alcohols can cause blindness if consumed.

                  After you’ve cleaned your still thoroughly, you’ll need to add
                  your botanical mix to your still column. For this, you will
                  roll up about 20 inches of copper packing and insert it into
                  the bottom section of your still’s column. Then wrap your
                  crushed botanical mix into a folded piece of cheesecloth. Be
                  sure to fold the sides of the cheesecloth upward to make a
                  small satchel. Tie a string around the top of your small
                  botanical satchel. Lower your botanical cheesecloth satchel
                  down the column onto the copper packing using the string. If
                  you are using a still with a site glass section, clamp it
                  below the section of your column with the copper packing. If
                  your still setup has a condenser, hook up your water input and
                  output. Next, you’re going to add your gin mash water into
                  your still. We highly recommend using a siphon for this
                  process. This method is the best way to reduce the amount of
                  sediment from your fermented gin mash water getting into the
                  still. Leaving particles and sediments in the mash water will
                  cause the distillate to burn and ruin your product, so be
                  diligent during this step.

        <article>

                <div class="Step 1"> <strong>Step 1 - Choose your Ingredients </strong>
                       
                       <p>

                            A great gin starts with a great mash.  Fortunately, gin’s base spirit can be made by fermenting and distilling almost any agricultural product.  As a result, there are a ton of different variations of mash types to choose from when making gin.  Most gins are made using a variety of grain such as corn, barley or wheat.  Although, there are many exceptions to this as well.  Distilleries have been known to use honey, molasses, apples, potatoes, grapes, carrots and many other ingredients in their gin mash bills.

                            For this walkthrough guide, we’ll be using wheat, rye, and malted barley for our gin mash ingredients.  But feel free to use whatever ingredients you would like to for the first phase of distillation.
                           
                       </p>

                   </div>
    
            <div class="Step 2"> <strong>Step 2 - Fermented Mash</strong>
                
                <p>
                    
                    Also known as Sour Mash, this is the key first ingredient in making Gin. Get a mixture of grain, malt and water – and condition with some amount of spent mash (previously fermented and distilled mash that still contains dead yeast, a good food source for live yeast). 
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="Step 3" > <strong>Step 3 - Fermentation </strong>

                    <p>

                            Store your gin mash and let ferment for 1 to 2 weeks. Use the method below to ensure a successful fermentation phase.

                            Check Fermentation: After 1 week of fermentation, take a bit of liquid (no solids) from the top of your gin mash. Put the liquid on a white plate or lid. Drip several drops of iodine into the liquid.
                            
                            If the liquid turns blue, this is because the iodine has reacted with starches still in your gin mash. This indicates that the mash still requires further fermentation. Repeat this process every few days until the fermentation stage is complete (no blue liquid).
                    
                        </p>


            </div>

            <div class="Step 4"> <strong>Step 4 - Strain you Gin Mesh Water </strong>

                    <p >

                            Siphon some mash water out of your mixture, leaving behind ALL solid material and sediments, and into a container to adjust pH. At this step, you should use a cheesecloth to strain your gin mash water. Leaving solid materials or sediment in your gin mash water will cause problems with the distillation phase.

                            (Advanced Tip!) Some distillers will add 2tsp of gypsum to their gin mash water at this point. They then test the pH of their mash water. The ideal pH is 5.8 to 6.0. Use citric acid to adjust the pH down and calcium carbonate to bring it up.

                        </p>

            <div class="Step 5"> <strong> Step 5 - Gin Botanicals </strong>

                <p>

                        This is where things get very exciting and experimental!  Botanicals are the ingredients that set gin apart from other spirits like moonshine and vodka.  The distilled spirit absorbs these gin botanicals while passing through the still’s column.

                        Every gin has a different blend of botanical ingredients.  Some of the most popular gin botanicals that distillers prefer to use in their spirits include:

            <div class="Step 6"> <strong> Step 6 - Distilling </strong>

                <p>

                        So far so good!  You’ve done all of the work necessary to actually produce your own fermented gin mash water.  Next, you’ll make your gin mash water a purer and concentrated spirit by distilling it.  The distillation process removes undesirable contents from the gin mash water that you’ll need to separate out and dispose of.  These include types alcohols such as acetaldehyde, acetone, and methanol.  These undesirable alcohols can cause blindness if consumed. 

                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="Step 7"> <strong> Step 7 - Add Botanicals </strong>

                <p>

                        After you’ve cleaned your still thoroughly, you’ll need to add your botanical mix to your still column.  For this, you will roll up about 20 inches of copper packing and insert it into the bottom section of your still’s column.  Then wrap your crushed botanical mix into a folded piece of cheesecloth.  Be sure to fold the sides of the cheesecloth upward to make a small satchel.  Tie a string around the top of your small botanical satchel.

                        Lower your botanical cheesecloth satchel down the column onto the copper packing using the string.  If you are using a still with a site glass section, clamp it below the section of your column with the copper packing.
                        
                        If your still setup has a condenser, hook up your water input and output.
                        
                        Next, you’re going to add your gin mash water into your still. We highly recommend using a siphon for this process. This method is the best way to reduce the amount of sediment from your fermented gin mash water getting into the still.  Leaving particles and sediments in the mash water will cause the distillate to burn and ruin your product, so be diligent during this step.
